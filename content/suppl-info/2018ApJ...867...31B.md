## Animated versions of Figures 5 and 6.

**Figure 5.** While young stars are clumped in action/velocity space, old stars are spread out - but not preferentially towards any part of action/velocity space.

**Figure 6.** Each subplot rotates, to better visualize the 3D plot. While previosuly we only considered slices in action space, this 3D plots shows that there is no clear distinction in the entirety of action space between young and old stars.
