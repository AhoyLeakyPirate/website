Cleaning foregrounds from future EoR surveys may imprint artificial bias in the measured 21&nbsp;cm power spectrum. Cross-spectra can be measured much more robustly in the presence of foregrounds. We show that if two line-intensity mapping surveys overlap with a 21&nbsp;cm survey, then the 21&nbsp;cm power spectra can be measured on large scales using only the cross-spectra between these fields.

Over time, stellar orbits are expected to become more non-circular and non-planar, described by their orbit's actions. Using two samples of stars with well-determined ages, we quantify the action-age relations. We demonstrate a correlation, but the spread on this relation is too large for actions to be used to infer stellar ages.

## Extracting Bias Using the Cross-bispectrum: An EoR and 21&nbsp;cm–[C&nbsp;II]–[C&nbsp;II] Case Study

The main obstacle to 21&nbsp;cm observation of the Epoch of Reionization are large foregrounds. One proposed cross-check is to cross-correlate 21&nbsp;cm observations from z~6-9 with intensity mapping surveys of, e.g., the [CII] line at the same redshifts. The downside of this approach is that you have to know about the evolution in the [CII] line in order to extract information about the EoR. We propose a similar cross-check that avoids this problem.

## Internal abstraction of dynemicin A: An MD approach

Dynemicin A is an anti-tumor drug which kills cancerous cells by binding to and cutting DNA. It is thought to work by inserting into the minor groove of DNA and then undergoing a cyclization process before abstracting a hydrogen atom from the DNA backbone. Intercalation, or inserting between two base pairs as opposed to in the minor groove, is thought to stop the activity of dynemicin A. We provide evidence that dynemicin A may abstract a hydrogen atom from itself first and then subsequently abstract a hydrogen atom from the DNA backbone.
