I am a senior undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania. I study physics with a focus on astrophysics and cosmology. I will be starting my PhD in Astronomy at Harvard University this fall (2019).

I am primarily interested in high-redshift cosmology, and in particular the Epoch of Reionization. I am also interested in Milky Way dynamics and galaxy formation, with an overall emphasis on extracting science from numerical simulations and cosmological implications of astrophysical processes. However, I am currently looking to build a broad knowledge and skill base.
