I am broadly interested in the interpretation of complicated datasets, particularly in the role and fidelity of numerical simulations in the pursuit of that goal. In the near-term, this means laying down a path to understanding the current and imminent surveys of the Milky Way. In the long-term, this will lead me to the elusive Epoch of Reionization.

## The Milky Way

Galaxy formation is a complicated topic. While we understand in broad strokes what the important physical processes are, a detailed understanding of their exact role and interplay currently evades the field. Advances are unlikely to be made by the identification of new processes but rather from improved understandings of processes presently known. A single, exquisitely understood specimen will aid in this pursuit more than even larger statistical samples of poorly understood galaxies.

Embedded within the disk of the Milky Way, our unique vantage point gives us a fighting chance. The Milky Way is the only galaxy we can observe on a star-by-star basis -- the only galaxy we can observe _in action_. We can observe in detail the stellar, gaseous, and dust components of the Milky Way, all of which interact in complicated ways. Stars are born from gas, gas influences the dynamics of stars, and dust inhibits our ability to view stars. We are in the middle of a flood of data on each of these components, which is only quickening. Of particular interest is the stellar component, for which precise dynamics will be available for hundreds of millions of stars from _Gaia_, precise stellar abundances for millions of stars from SDSS-V, and precise and accurate ages from a variety of methods.

My aim is to understand these datasets using numerical simulations of the Milky Way. I am particularly interested in using _isolated_ simulations -- as opposed to zoom-in simulations. Isolated simulations are better suited to this job because they can be tuned to match structural properties of the Milky Way. This is important for understanding certain, particular aspects of the Milky Way -- for instance, the influence of the bar on the gaseous and stellar components. Laboratory experiments can be performed with these isolated simulations -- _how does the system change when the mass of Sagittarius is changed? how does anisotropy of gas accretion influence the evolution of the disk? how does accretion onto the central supermassive black hole affect the Central Molecular Zone?_ These questions, and many more, can be addressed with isolated simulations.


## The Epoch of Reionization

While the datasets for the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) are not as mature as for the Milky Way, they are coming. When they arrive, it will be imperative to rethink our current techniques for interpreting important signals from the era. While my goals in the regime are in the longer-term, I will use numerical simulations to aid in the interpretation of what will no doubt be incredibly complicated datasets.

<!-- ## Measuring the EoR Power Spectrum Without Measuring the EoR Power Spectrum

Cleaning foregrounds from future EoR surveys may imprint artificial bias in the measured 21&nbsp;cm power spectrum. Cross-spectra can be measured much more robustly in the presence of foregrounds. We show that if two line-intensity mapping surveys overlap with a 21&nbsp;cm survey, then the 21&nbsp;cm power spectra can be measured on large scales using only the cross-spectra between these fields.

## Actions Are Weak Stellar Age Indicators in the Milky Way Disk
_with [Melissa K. Ness][7] (CCA/Columbia) and [Megan Bedell][8] (CCA)_

{{< figure src="images/2018ApJ...867...31B.png" class="rightalign" width="325" >}}

Over time, stellar orbits are expected to become more non-circular and non-planar, described by their orbit's actions. Using two samples of stars with well-determined ages, we quantify the action-age relations. We demonstrate a correlation, but the spread on this relation is too large for actions to be used to infer stellar ages.

## Extracting Bias Using the Cross-bispectrum: An EoR and 21&nbsp;cm–[C&nbsp;ɪɪ]–[C&nbsp;ɪɪ] Case Study
_with [Adam Lidz][12] (UPenn)_

{{< figure src="images/2018ApJ...867...26B.jpg" class="rightalign" width="325" >}}

The main obstacle to 21&nbsp;cm observation of the Epoch of Reionization are large foregrounds. One proposed cross-check is to cross-correlate 21&nbsp;cm observations from z\~6-9 with intensity mapping surveys of, e.g., the [C&nbsp;ɪɪ] line at the same redshifts. The downside of this approach is that you have to know about the evolution in the [C&nbsp;ɪɪ] line in order to extract information about the EoR. We propose a similar cross-check that avoids this problem.

## Internal abstraction of dynemicin A: An MD approach
_with [Bill Miller III][15] (Truman State University) and [Carol Parish][16] (University of Richmond)_

{{< figure src="images/Beane_JMolGraphModel.png" class="rightalign" width="325" >}}

Dynemicin A is an anti-tumor drug which kills cancerous cells by binding to and cutting DNA. It is thought to work by inserting into the minor groove of DNA and then undergoing a cyclization process before abstracting a hydrogen atom from the DNA backbone. Intercalation, or inserting between two base pairs as opposed to in the minor groove, is thought to stop the activity of dynemicin A. We provide evidence that dynemicin A may abstract a hydrogen atom from itself first and then subsequently abstract a hydrogen atom from the DNA backbone even in the intercalated state.
