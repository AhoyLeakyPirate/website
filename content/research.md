text="Over time, stellar orbits are expected to become more non-circular and non-planar, described by their orbit's actions. Using two samples of stars with well-determined ages, we quantify the action-age relations and demonstrate a correlation. However, the spread on this relation is too large for actions to be used to infer stellar ages."
