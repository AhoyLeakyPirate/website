I am a senior undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania. I study physics with a focus on astrophysics and cosmology. For the fall 2018 semester, I am working full-time at the Center for Computational Astrophysics.

I am primarily interested in high-redshift cosmology, and in particular the Epoch of Reionization. I am also interested in Milky Way dynamics and galaxy formation, with an overall emphasis on extracting science from numerical simulations. However, I am currently looking to build a broad knowledge and skill base.
